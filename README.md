# LiteDAO

** THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING SUPPORTED.  DUE TO CHANGES TO OBJECTIVES, IT IS NOW [IniLiteORM](https://github.com/MoffettMcKenna/IniLiteORM) **

This is my attempt at building a simple wrapper around SQLite3 for python.  This is really meant to be a library I can use personally in several other projects.  It hides the complicated SQL details from the caller and provides easy access to the data.
